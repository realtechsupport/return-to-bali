<i>Introduction</i>
<br><br>
Return to Baliâ€™s goal is to facilitate the creation of under-represented knowledge in machine learning. Return to Bali applies various
machine learning procedures to the study of Ethnobotany on the island of Bali where Mead and Bateson,
of second order cybernetics fame, collected field data for the book Balinese Character: A Photographic Analysis (1942).
<br><br>
While Bali has been subject to numerous exploitative practices, this project aims to bend machine learning to collect data responsibly
and to assess if machine learning might help maintain the body of local ecological knowledge
that has been documented as declining specifically amongst Balinese youth.
<br><br>
The software modules included here allow one to parse text from video interviews and to experiment with various image classification
approaches on the bali-26 data set, the first small collection of ethnobotanically significant plants
 of South East Asia made amendable to neural network based image classification. The project demonstrates that even the best
 machine learning algorithms struggle to understand  the complex visual information contained in this image set.

<br><br>
More practically, Return to Bali shows how anyone with a mobile phone can create viable datasets for image classification
and train state of the art convolutional neural networks with these datasets.
It will hopefully facilitate similar projects in other underrepresented domains.
